				<p>Today I had a quick go at <a href="http://patchspace.co.uk/">Patchspace&rsquo;s</a> Ash Moran&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/patchspace/katas/tree/master/pocket_calculator">Pocket Calculator kata</a>. I tried this once before when I was taking my first steps into BDD and found it quite challenging. In retrospect I think part of this might have been partly due to my lack of familiarisation with the tools I was using, specifically SpecFlow.</p>
<p>I have since started just using unit tests when doing BDD as I find it avoids the &ldquo;framework&rdquo; distraction and let&rsquo;s you and the customer really concentrate on the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Today I started with turning the calculator on by pressing the AC button. I was expecting the screen to display &ldquo;0.&rdquo;. With this test quickly passing and a quick refactor to pass in a display object rather than getting the total, I moved on to the next test: entering numbers.</p>
<p>I easily added this feature by adding an if statement to my press method. With my tests passing again I tried to find a way of <a href="http://www.antiifcampaign.com/">removing the if</a>. I couldn&rsquo;t see a simple way of doing this in Ruby. In C# I would pass in a dictionary mapping types to lambdas which would take two arguments: the button pressed and the current value being displayed. I&rsquo;m a bit unsure about how good a solution this as it isn&rsquo;t very object oriented. I suppose that it could be wrapped in a class instead though. I decided to leave the if in for now and move on to the next test.</p>
<p>Next up was entering multiple numbers. I changed the part of the code that handled numbers to prepend the button press to the existing display. I was still unhappy with the if, but unfortunately I had run out of time.</p>
<p>I will continue my fight against conditionals tomorrow and hopefully get chance to write up my findings.</p>
