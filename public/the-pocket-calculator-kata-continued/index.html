				<p>I continued my work on the pocket calculator kata at lunch today. Previously I have been struggling to remove a big if else statement and was unsure of the best approach to take. I started off by writing another test. That an operator press resets the display to &ldquo;0.&rdquo;. To get my test passing I simply added an elsif to my existing if statement that I was using to dispatch the button presses. Now that I was on green again and with the extra test under my belt I felt more confident about refactoring out the if statement. I started by introducing a mapping from button presses to symbols describing the type of button press. For example, 1 maps to :number and = maps to :operator. I ran the tests: still passing. Next I created handler classes for each symbol and made each one an observer of the display (self in this case). This got most of my tests passing again, except for one. I had neglected the fact that this meant I no longer had a way of tracking state, so my test for pressing &ldquo;1&rdquo; twice should display &ldquo;11&rdquo; was now failing as it was &ldquo;1&rdquo; instead. I&rsquo;m not sure how to proceed from here. Would it be better to go back to how it was? Should I press on? My gut says to go back to how it was rather than refactor even more with broken tests. Unfortunately I&rsquo;m out of time, so I will have to decide next time.</p>
