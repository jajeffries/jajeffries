				<p>For me, slack is one of the most important of all agile development principles. It means exactly what it sounds like: having slack in your system. This can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than enough time to finish the work</li>
<li>Autonomy to work how you think will be best in a given situation</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of this are enormous. It gives you sustainable pace, a chance to mentor or learn from your colleagues, an increase in the quality of your work, a chance to improve your work system, refactor old difficult to work with sections of code&hellip; the list goes on. So why doesn&rsquo;t everyone just introduce more slack into their system? Because people need to deliver, but they can&rsquo;t because the code is hard to work with, code quality is low, and no one has time to refactor and make things better. Someone (maybe Uncle Bob) said something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast, good, cheap: pick two</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problems I just described came from systems optimised for fast and cheap. So if we cant to focus on making things better this seems like a bad combination and leaves us with two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast and good</li>
<li>Cheap and good</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast and good means delivering something of a higher quality sooner, but either with less features (a change in scope) or more resources (adding people to a failing project is a whole different discussion). Most companies are (rightly) hesitant to add more people, but I have seen adding another couple of people help as it can give the extra slack needed to make improvements. Cheap and good means delivering something of a higher quality with the same amount of resources. This means that either the scope or the delivery date has to change. In my opinion, fixed scope fixed date projects are the enemy of slack. So next time you get your gant charts out, start thinking about what the long term effects on your team will be if you set a date and scope at the beginning.</p>
