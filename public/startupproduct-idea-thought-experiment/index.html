				<p>This morning I saw this tweet from Mike Sutton (<a href="https://twitter.com/mhsutton">@mhsutton</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/mhsutton/status/567651832219312128">https://twitter.com/mhsutton/status/567651832219312128</a> This got me thinking.Â In the past I&rsquo;ve blogged about how <a href="https://jajeffries.wordpress.com/2014/08/12/innovation-feeds-creativity/">constraints can help creativity</a>. I wonder if you could apply existing successful startups as a constraint to a particular field. So, in Mike&rsquo;s example, the field would be healthcare and the constraint would be uber. Now, Mike has suggested that it could be a plumber sidelining as a doctor, but what else could it be? A few ideas off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>A service where the doctor comes to you, when you need it and you just pay for their time.</li>
<li>On demand appointments at a variety of locations</li>
<li>Booking appointments through an app, which triages you based on symptoms you put enter</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Just to be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying any of these are necessarily good or useful ideas. They&rsquo;re just to illustrate a point. Maybe you can think of some ideas too. Maybe (or probably) better ideas. Now have a think about how you could apply this idea to a field that you know about and see if you can come up with some interesting ideas. What could the <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/">AirBnB</a> of networking be? Or the <a href="https://www.datingring.com/">TheDatingRing</a> of cycling? Thought experiments like this can be a great way of helping you get creative. If this one doesn&rsquo;t fit what you&rsquo;re trying to do right now, have a go at coming up with your own.</p>
