				<p>NOTE: This was written on Friday, but I didn&rsquo;t get chance to post it. Today&rsquo;s kata was uncle Bob&rsquo;s bowling in JavaScript. I started off writing a test for rolling all gutter balls. This let me quickly and easily get a passing test. I used the self shunt pattern to record the score by passing in the score leader board. Rather than refactor at this point I decided to add a test for scoring 1 on each roll. This added some triangulation forcing me to process the input rather than just update the score leader board with 0. Next I decided to start working on strikes. This was slightly more challenging as it changed the length of the input, which at that point I was relying on. As a quick fix I replaced any strikes in the input string with &lsquo;10 0&rsquo;. This gave me the correct amount of rolls again. I partitioned the string into an array of arrays and converted the strings to integers. So &lsquo;1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1&rsquo; became [[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1],[1, 1]]. Now all my tests were passing, but I wasn&rsquo;t too happy with some of the code. I was dealing with arrays a lot and felt that I could encapsulate this better in an object, so I introduced a Frame class. I feel that this made the code much more readable and easier to reason about as the language was that of the domain not just data structures.</p>
