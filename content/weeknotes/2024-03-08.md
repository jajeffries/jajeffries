- I've been getting back into doing some leetcode problems. I'm working through from the highest acceptance level and working down.
- Got a github runner working on a raspberry pi, so that I don't have to try and get cross mn working
  - Enjoying using ansible for managing my home network devices. Keeps it simple, repeatable, and documented.
