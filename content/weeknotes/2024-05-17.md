## Interesting things I've read this week
- [A paper on systematic concurrency testing](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/homepages/papers/pdfs/PhdTheses/PaulThomson.pdf)
- [Static chess](https://www.val.town/v/maxm/staticChess) - pure html, css and js implementation of css that you can be multiplayer. I might use this to share some interesting puzzles I come across
- [docker ARG gotchas](https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2024/05/13/using-arg-in-a-dockerfile-beware-the-gotcha/) - I saw this on HN but by chance I ran into this issue earlier this week while trying to get our cypress image sizes down a bit using [cypress/factory](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/factory/)
- [Some nice visualisations of Christopher Alexander's design theory work](https://camillovisini.com/writing/fifteen-fundamental-properties) - some of his ideas about patterns were what influenced the software design patterns movement.
