- Seem to have spent quite a bit of time firefighting early in the week. One of our soon-to-be-retired services which I'm not very familiar with and isn't particularly operable (not much in the way of docs, runbooks, clear monitoring etc) which made things take longer than it should have done.
- Completed my first leetcode hard problem - using dynamic programming too, which I usually find difficult.

## Interesting things I've read this week
- [A paper on systematic concurrency testing](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/homepages/papers/pdfs/PhdTheses/PaulThomson.pdf)
- [Static chess](https://www.val.town/v/maxm/staticChess) - pure html, css and js implementation of chess that can be multiplayer by shairng links. I might use this to share some interesting puzzles I come across
- [docker ARG gotchas](https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2024/05/13/using-arg-in-a-dockerfile-beware-the-gotcha/) - I saw this on HN but by chance I ran into this issue earlier this week while trying to get our cypress image sizes down a bit using [cypress/factory](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/factory/)
- [Some nice visualisations of Christopher Alexander's design theory work](https://camillovisini.com/writing/fifteen-fundamental-properties) - some of his ideas about patterns were what influenced the software design patterns movement.
- [Why objects are inevitable](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/objects-essay.pdf)
