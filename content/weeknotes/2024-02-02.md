- Been doing some technical but not computer stuff this week
  - bought a VHF/UHF radio, learnt to use it and listened in on a local club net
  - had a look at getting a licence
    - looks pretty straight forward as I already know most of the physics required for the exam
- Facilitated a productive post incident review. Lots of discussion and came up with some interesting actions from it.
