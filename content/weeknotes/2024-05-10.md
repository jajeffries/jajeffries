- Had a play around with [ray.io](https://www.ray.io/). It's overkill for my little project, but can see how it would be useful for larger projects running more complex workloads

## Interesting things I've read this week
- [Defence against AI Traffic Analysis (DAITA)](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/introducing-defense-against-ai-guided-traffic-analysis-daita)
- [Google's new time series foundation model](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm)
- [Temporal Python](https://temporal.io/blog/durable-distributed-asyncio-event-loop) - this looks a bit too much like Azure's durable functions, which I've had lots of pain with recently
