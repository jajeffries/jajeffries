- been optimising my side project which imports large amounts of data into a postgresql database
  - I thought the constraint would be anlysing/querying the data but actually ingesting it quickly enough is hard too
  - been using rust async and Postgres common table expressions

# Interesting things I've read this week
- [A random number generator that you can do in you head](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/randomness/)
- [Rust Async Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/)
- [Postgres Common Table Expressions (CTE)](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-recursive-query/)
- [Loro - a different approach to state management (mostly aimed at text I think but I can see how it could be applied to other areas)](https://www.loro.dev/)
  - Some highlights from reading more about loro:
