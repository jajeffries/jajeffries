- Did some thinking about idempotency for a service I work on. Specifically how do we stop processing duplicate messages. It's _relatively_ easy to reason about this when you're doing something like storing a row in a database (as you can check if you stored it and ignore if you have), but a bit harder when you're orchestrating a series of distributed functions. Instead you need to examine something in the message, often either an ID set by the producer of the message, or hash the message contents itself and check that against the messages you've already processed.

# Interesting things I've read this week
- [This old paper on concurrency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/322123.322134) popped up on hacker news, which reminded me of [CSP](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf) so I went back and read that paper too
- [Everyone seems to be jumping on the rust bandwagon](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/google_rust_donation/)
- [Google's Rust training (specifically the bit on concurrency)](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html)
- [A good collection of resources on graph analytics](https://wiki.pathmind.com/graph-analysis)
- [Meta's Simple Precision Time Protocol](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/02/07/production-engineering/simple-precision-time-protocol-sptp-meta/)
