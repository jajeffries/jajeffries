- Did some thinking about idempotency for a service I work on. Specifically, how do we stop processing duplicate messages? It's _relatively_ easy to reason about this when you're doing something like storing a row in a database (as you can check if you stored it and ignore it if you have), but a bit harder when you're orchestrating a series of distributed functions. Instead, you need to examine something in the message, often either an ID set by the producer of the message, or hash the message contents itself and check that against the messages you've already processed.
- My current team prefers solo working to pair or ensemble programming, and also focuses slightly more on upfront design than I'm used to. My preference is for lots of synchronous collaboration, whereas they prefer more asynchronous collaboration. I feel that I need to get better at these ways of working again, having been used to them in previous roles.

# Interesting things I've read this week
- [This old paper on concurrency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/322123.322134) popped up on hacker news, which reminded me of [CSP](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf) so I went back and read that paper too
- [Everyone seems to be jumping on the rust bandwagon](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/google_rust_donation/)
- [Google's Rust training (specifically the bit on concurrency)](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html)
- [A good collection of resources on graph analytics](https://wiki.pathmind.com/graph-analysis)
- [Meta's Simple Precision Time Protocol](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/02/07/production-engineering/simple-precision-time-protocol-sptp-meta/)
