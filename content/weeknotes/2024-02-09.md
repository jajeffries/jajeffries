- Been doing some technical but not computer stuff this week
  - bought a VHF/UHF radio, learnt to use it and listened in on a local club net
  - had a look at getting a licence
    - looks pretty straight forward as I already know most of the physics required for the exam
- Facilitated a productive post incident review. Lots of discussion and came up with some interesting actions from it.

# Interesting things I've read this week
- [This old paper on concurrency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/322123.322134) popped up on hacker news, which reminded me of [CSP](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf) so I went back and read that paper too
- [Everyone seems to be jumping on the rust bandwagon](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/google_rust_donation/)
- [Google's Rust training (specifically the bit on concurrency)](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html)
