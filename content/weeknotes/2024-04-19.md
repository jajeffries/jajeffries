- Trying to get back into weeknotes after a bit of time off from them
- Did some systems dynamics modelling on the train back from london to try and better understand what levers we can pull to get more traction with different parts of the business

## Interesting things I've read this week
- [An illustrated explanation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8EFA77D663D585B68630E372BCE1EBA4/S0956796824000017a.pdf/knuth-morris-pratt-illustrated.pdf)
- [Stumbled on the idea of using multicast DNS for service discovery (doesn't fit what I needed to do, but still an interesting idea)](http://multicastdns.org/)
- [mDNS led me to the concept of zero config networking (another interesting idea, that doesn't solve the problem I currently have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking)
