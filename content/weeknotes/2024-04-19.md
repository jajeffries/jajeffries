- Trying to get back into weeknotes after a bit of time off from them
- Did some systems dynamics modelling on the train back from London to try and better understand what levers we can pull to get more traction with different parts of the business
- Spent some time thinking about reducing the size of the pull requests in our team after reading [this case study](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/)
  - Given the size of the team (2 devs) also need to consider the effect that lots of smaller code reviews would have
  - Essentially I think the transaction cost is the cost of context switching for the other developer, but batching up reduces review quality and flow of work

## Interesting things I've read this week
- [An illustrated explanation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8EFA77D663D585B68630E372BCE1EBA4/S0956796824000017a.pdf/knuth-morris-pratt-illustrated.pdf)
- [Stumbled on the idea of using multicast DNS for service discovery (doesn't fit what I needed to do, but still an interesting idea)](http://multicastdns.org/)
- [mDNS led me to the concept of zero config networking (another interesting idea, that doesn't solve the problem I currently have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking)
