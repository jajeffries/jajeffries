- A fun puzzle someone showed me - what's the chance that we both pick the same number between 1 and 100? The answer isn't 1 / 10000...
- Done some more leetcode between things this week. Finding that about half the medium problems I do take about 10 mins, the other half much longer. Probably a sign that there's some gaps in my algorithm knowledge I think.
  
## Interesting things I've read this week
