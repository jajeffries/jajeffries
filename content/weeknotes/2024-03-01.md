- Busy week at home and work this week, so didnt get round to writing much.
- I've been reflecting on what it is I like about writing software. I think it's making a difference in something I care about, whether that's open source, a better internet, climate etc.

# Interesting things I've read this week
- I finally got round to starting Tidy First by Kent Beck. Good so far, like the small sections. Makes it easier to digest.
