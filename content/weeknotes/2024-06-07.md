- Spent some time debugging some code that was leaking transaction to an Azure SQL database. Really enjoyed this. Used [the saff squeeze](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/the-saff-squeeze) to track it down and then took inspiration from [this excellent article](https://www.sommarskog.se/error_handling/Part1.html) to fix it.
- Been playing with a new tool I found for running commands based on file changes - [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr). I've been using this to regenerate grpahql code whenever I make changes to the schema.

## Interesting things I've read this week
- [A Hallucinogenic Compendium](https://cyberneticforests.substack.com/p/a-hallucinogenic-compendium) - arguing that we shouldn't be using LLMs for search
- [A novel approach to dynamic system analysis using graphs and OpenTelemetry data](https://acnsci.org/journal/index.php/jec/article/view/728/734)
  - This led me to refreshing my memory on [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
- [Alistair Cockburn on psychology in software engineering](https://web.archive.org/web/20140329203655/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear,+first-order+components+in+software+development)

- [Platform Organisation Mnaifesto](https://boundaryless.io/blog/platformorgmanifesto/?trk=feed-detail_comments-list_comment-text) - not come across this idea before, but it reminds me of reading about how people at Steam self organise.
- [Another great post from Kentik on why short RPKI ROA expiries are useful](https://www.kentik.com/blog/times-up-how-rpki-roas-perpetually-are-about-to-expire/)
