- I saw this [blog post](https://blog.idcrypt.global/2024/02/19/amp-early-access-program/) about signing and verifying images. This is a cool idea, but I'm not sure how much it will help in the long run as you could surely sign an AI generated image and post it on X. Anyway, it got me wondering about how data can be put into jpegs, which led me to this [blog post](https://blog.nviso.eu/2020/07/13/how-to-embed-secret-data-in-jpeg-files/) explaining it. I think it would be pretty cool to be able to sign and verify images using gpg signatures. Might have a quick play around with that at some point.
