- Got bitten by an [obscure terraform bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/20441) this week. Got a work around in place, but I'm going to try and put a PR in for a fix when I get time.
- Introducing my team to event storming this week. Been a while so I need to brush up.
