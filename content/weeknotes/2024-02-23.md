- I saw this [blog post](https://blog.idcrypt.global/2024/02/19/amp-early-access-program/) about signing and verifying images. This is a cool idea, but I'm not sure how much it will help in the long run as you could surely sign an AI generated image and post it on X. Anyway, it got me wondering about how data can be put into jpegs, which led me to this [blog post](https://blog.nviso.eu/2020/07/13/how-to-embed-secret-data-in-jpeg-files/) explaining it. I think it would be pretty cool to be able to sign and verify images using gpg signatures. Might have a quick play around with that at some point.
- I tried out [a caching solution](https://blog.readyset.io/dont-use-kv-stores/) for caching some complex long running postgres queries. Works well but took me a little while to set up. Essentially you query a the cache and the cache will keep the values up to date by listening like a replica would for changes to what it has in the cache.
  - It's a neat idea, but for my use case I think materialised views refreshed by pg_cron or similar might be a simpler solution
- Got a project running on my new raspberry pi 5 to process some data every few hours and save the results in a database, which at the moment I run some adhoc queries on. At some point I'll write something to analyse the results and visualise it. This was costing me about 40 quid a month on digital ocean, and now will cost whatever the electricity to run it costs. I'm managing it using ansible and k8s (specifically [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/)), both of which I've used before but I'm a bit rusty so I've been brushing up.
