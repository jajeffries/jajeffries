- second week on new team - some new tech
- hit the windows max file length - which it turns out can be turned off in the registry?! Maybe it's been kept in place for some bizarre compatibility scenario
- spent some time reflecting on feedback loops for tests - plotted average test run duration against cycle time and found a weak but definite linear correlation
- I've been listening to [The Lovecraft Investigations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spb8w) - a modern interpretation of some HP Lovecraft stories set as an investigative podcast
