I'm a Manchester based software developer with experience in varied domains, including finance, ecommerce, and networking. In that time I've worked in everything from small pre-revenue startups to large multinational organisations, in a variety of languages and technologies. I'm interested in working on complex problems, building teams and having fun along the way.
