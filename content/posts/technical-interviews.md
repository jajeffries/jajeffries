I've been thinking a bit about technical interviews recently. I've interviewed dozens of people over the last few years, but I'm still not really satisfied with how any of them have gone. I still rarely come out of an interview thinking "I know this person has the technical skills I'm looking for". I tend to favour working through katas or refactoring problems to see peoples design and TDD skills while talking to them about times they've done similar things or probing for more detail if I think there's more there. But even after sitting and writing code with them I find it hard to know whether someone didn't perform well because of nerves, pressure or they just don't know what they're doing. Questioning can help, but doing that can feel like it's adding even more pressure. I don't know what the answer is here, but I'm sure there's a better way than what I'm doing now.
