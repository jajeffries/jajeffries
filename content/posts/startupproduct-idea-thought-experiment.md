This morning I saw this tweet from Mike Sutton ([@mhsutton](https://twitter.com/mhsutton)) https://twitter.com/mhsutton/status/567651832219312128 This got me thinking.Â In the past I've blogged about how [constraints can help creativity](https://jajeffries.wordpress.com/2014/08/12/innovation-feeds-creativity/). I wonder if you could apply existing successful startups as a constraint to a particular field. So, in Mike's example, the field would be healthcare and the constraint would be uber. Now, Mike has suggested that it could be a plumber sidelining as a doctor, but what else could it be? A few ideas off the top of my head:

*   A service where the doctor comes to you, when you need it and you just pay for their time.
*   On demand appointments at a variety of locations
*   Booking appointments through an app, which triages you based on symptoms you put enter
*   etc etc

NOTE: Just to be clear, I'm not saying any of these are necessarily good or useful ideas. They're just to illustrate a point. Maybe you can think of some ideas too. Maybe (or probably) better ideas. Now have a think about how you could apply this idea to a field that you know about and see if you can come up with some interesting ideas. What could the [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/) of networking be? Or the [TheDatingRing](https://www.datingring.com/) of cycling? Thought experiments like this can be a great way of helping you get creative. If this one doesn't fit what you're trying to do right now, have a go at coming up with your own.
