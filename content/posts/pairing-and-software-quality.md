I currently pair on almost everything. But not always in the traditional way. We don't both sit at the same computer and we both work on different things. Instead we tackle different parts of the same problem at the same time. We talk through the solution at a high level first, then get started while constantly communicate, asking questions and discussing problems. If we get stuck or are working on a difficult section of code then we ask the other for help. The usual benefits cited when talking about pair programming are:

*   Faster learning of development practices and design
*   Faster learning of the domain
*   Increased focus

Due to the constant collaboration, I feel that we still get these benefits from working in the way described above. Maybe, not to the same extent as we would if we were sat at the same computer, but close. Combining this with the extra speed we gain from approaching a problem from two angles allows us to move really quickly. But what about quality? Lean and systems thinking suggest that the best way to reduce waste is to focus on quality. For me this is the biggest argument for pair programming. Increasing the quality of a code base allows you to make changes more cheaply, requires you to fix less bugs and write less unnecessary defensive code. Would this approach work without a good quality code that was SOLID, loosely coupled, well covered by (reasonably) quick automated tests? I think probably not. Focus on quality and the rest will follow.
