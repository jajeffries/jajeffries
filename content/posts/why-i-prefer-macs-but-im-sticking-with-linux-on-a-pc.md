I have always been a PC user. Since I've been old enough to have my own computer, it's always been a PC running various flavours of linux. Recently I bought my first Apple product, a second hand iPad 2. I think it's great: fantastic UI, good hardware, good battery life etc.

And at work I've been using a MacBook Pro. Again, this is brilliant. Great hardware, incredible screen fantastic overall user experience.

But for my home laptop, I'm sticking with my 7 year old Lenovo X60. This is my favourite laptop I've ever used. It's slower and the screen is not as good as my MacBook, but for the price I certainly wouldn't buy a MacBook myself.

My **Lenovo cast £70. **It has a 32-bit dual core processor, 3GB of RAM and a terrabyte harddrive. If it breaks I can get another one on eBay to be delivered the next day for less than the price of Apple Care on a new MacBook. If I need parts (motherboard, screen etc.) then I can buy a new laptop for less than the price of the parts of the MacBook.

For what I use it for, some development, internet browsing, etc. I can't find fault in my old Lenovo.
