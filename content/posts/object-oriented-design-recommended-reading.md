> So now I read [#poodr](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23poodr&src=hash) and got excited again about design what is the next book I should read?

POODR is Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz. It's a fantastic book, which I would recommend to anyone working with an object oriented language, not just Ruby. As I went through the list of replies I found myself bookmarking the various other recommendations and thought others might benefit from it. So here is the full list so far:

I don't think I've missed any frmo the conversation, but Twitter's UI makes it very hard to tell.
